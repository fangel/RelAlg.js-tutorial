            This tutorial will take the form of a series of questions. These 
            often require you to perform tasks without using RelAlg.js at 
            first. <br />
            This is to evaluate how much of a help using RelAlg.js is to you,
            and it's therefore important that you actually try and preform them
            either in your head or on paper.<br /> 
            For all exercises that you should use RelAlg.js, it will be clearly
            stated.
          </p>
          <p>
            After each question, there will be a rating-bar. This will be a 1-5
            rating of how much you agree with the assessment.<br />
            You answer by clicking the &#9733; that best describes your your 
            answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            For difficulty questions, 1 means a walk in the park and 5 means very difficult.
            <br />
            For helpfulness questions, 1 means that it didn't help you at all and 5 means it
            made the job much easier. <br />
            For agreement questions, 1 means you totally disagree, and 5 means you totally
            agree.
